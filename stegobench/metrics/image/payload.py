"""
Payload-level metrics for image-based steganography.

This module provides utility functions to compare a known payload
(secret message) with one extracted from an image after decoding.

Included Metrics
----------------
- bitwise_ber: Bit Error Rate between original and extracted payload.
- byte_accuracy: Byte-level match percentage.
- exact_match: Bitwise equality.

Assumptions
-----------
* Payloads are raw bytes or file paths pointing to binary data.
* This module does not extract hidden data â€” it only compares.
